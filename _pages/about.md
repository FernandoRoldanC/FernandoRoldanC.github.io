Currently, I am academic collaborator at the Departamento de Ingeniería Matemática of the Universidad de Concepción. I received my PhD. (2022) from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile. In 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA in the CVN laboratory at Centralesupélec.

My research area is splitting algorithms for solving monotone inclusions with applications on convex optimization and image processing.
